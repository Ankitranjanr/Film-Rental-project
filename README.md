# Film-Rental-sql-project

Description about the project: In this scenario, the owner of a film rental store seeks assistance in generating important business reports using SQL queries. The store's database contains tables related to films, actors, customers, rentals, and staff. Due to the absence of their usual helper, the owner reaches out to a friend for support. The tasks involve analysing revenue, rental frequency, film details, category popularity, customer behaviour, and foreign key constraints. Additionally, views are created to summarize revenue by staff and store location, as well as to display rental information and customer spending percentages. The final task is to identify customers who paid 50% of their rental costs within one day.

Key skills: Joins, Clauses, Subqueries, Views, Aggregate functions & Temp tables
